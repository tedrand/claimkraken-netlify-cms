## About the Author

The owner and sole proprietor of ClaimKraken.com, Theodore Rand, is currently a third-year law student at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law. Theodore is a U.S. Registered Patent Agent (Registration Number - 77,446). He serves as the Chief Article Editor of the UNH Law Review and is a former Teaching Assistant for Legal Writing 1 and 2. He is also an incoming Associate at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, supporting the firm's Silicon Valley patent prosecution and litigation practice groups. 

Before law school, Theodore worked as a Software Developer and a Support Engineer at several technology companies and has a specialized focus in JavaScript and the AdTech industry. As a patent attorney, his goal is to facilitate innovation by being a helpful and non-intrusive resource to engineers and inventors who will listen attentively, learn about the technology, and provide legal assistance without forcing inventors to learn about the burdensome technical aspects of the law.

In his free time, Theodore enjoys traveling with his fiancee, learning about new technologies, writing code (like the code for this website), and playing Magic the Gathering.
