There are several different types of patent applications that can be filed in the United States. A competent patent attorney must understand when and how to file each type of application. 

## Provisional Patent Application

The provisional patent application (Provisional) filing type was introduced to U.S. patent law in 1994 by an amendment to the Patent Act of 1952. Provisionals are filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(b). While the practice of filing Provisionals is relatively new, it has now become a ubiquitous industry standard as a way to secure the earliest possible filing date for a patent. 

While claims are "the name of the game," so to speak, as discussed in [my article on patent claims](https://www.claimkraken.com/blog/2021-01-04-what-is-a-patent-claim/), They are not actually required in a Provisional. Additionally, an oath or declaration and Information Disclosure Statement (IDS) are not required. 

So at this point, you may be asking, why is all this stuff not necessary for a Provisional, and what actually *is required*? Well, the first thing to understand is the purpose of filing a provisional. Unlike a Utility Patent Application, which I will discuss, a Provisional's purpose is not to be examined by a patent examiner to determine if the requirements to grant a patent are met. Rather, it is simply to secure a filing dateâ€”the date for which the invention's novelty is to be established. 

To establish the patent application's filing date, *no new matter* can be added to the Utility Patent Application that was not in the Provisional. Not in the Claims, and not in the Specification. Patentees can and normally will make formal changes to the disclosure's structure to look more like a patent document. The only component that is absolutely required to obtain a filing date for a Provisional is a written specification. For Provisionals filed after December 18, 2013, drawings are not technically required. *See* 37 CFR 1.53. However, because of the requirement that no new matter can be added after the filing date, it is fairly dangerous to file a provisional without drawings. Drawings can convey so much detail that is later used to claim the inventive aspects of the disclosure.
