Patents secure rights for inventions that are "new" or "novel." This means that before a patent can be granted, patent examiners must determine whether the invention can be found in the "prior art." Thus, it is prudent to search for prior art before applying for a patent to determine what part of the invention can be claimed under a patent. This article will discuss some of the basic concepts of prior art and performing prior art searches.

## What is Prior Art?

So, which kinds of information are considered by patent examiners when they determine whether a patent claim is to a "novel" idea. The answer technically depends on which jurisdiction the patentee is considering filing in. For instance, the European Patent Office (EPO) defines prior art as "any evidence that your invention is already known." In contrast, the United States Patent and Trademark Office defines prior art as "those references or documents *which may be used to determine novelty and/or non-obviousness* of the claimed subject matter in a patent application. As the definition implies, the United States patent laws explicitly define what references may be used to determine novelty and non-obviousness. Before the passage of the America Invents Act (the AIA), certain foreign references were excluded from the body of prior art. However, the new laws essentially include any publicly available information as prior art.

35 U.S.C. Section 102(a)-(b) defines the conditions required for patent claims to be novel. While the "grace period exceptions" under 102(b) are crucially important to a formal understanding of personally-generated prior art (such as, for instance, marketing disclosures), this article will focus on Section 102(a), which state that "\[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unlessâ€”

> (1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed public, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention; or 
>
> (2) the claimed invention was described in a patent issued under section 151, or in an application for patent published or deemed published under section 122(b), in which the patent or application, as the case may be, names another inventor and was effectively filed before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.

Essentially, 102(a)(1) boils down to three fundamental types of priors art.

### 1. "...patented, described in a printed publication,"

According to Federal Circuit case law, '"printed publication" has been interpreted to mean that before the critical date the reference must have been sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art; dissemination and public accessibility are the keys to the legal determination whether a prior art reference was 'published.'"<sup>1</sup> This does not mean that prior art must be indexed in a publicly available library or web engine in order to be considered. For instance, slides displayed at a scientific conference may be considered "sufficiently accessible to the public interest in the art."

### 2. "or in public use, on sale,"



### 3. "or otherwise available to the public..."



102(a)(2) includes U.S. patent documents that have a 102(a)(2) "effectively filed" prior art date. There are three types of U.S. patent documents that would fall into this category:

1. U.S. patents
2. U.S. patent application publications 
3. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) publications of PCT applications that designate the U.S.

## How to Search for Prior Art

There are a plethora of tools, methodologies, and professional search agencies that can be utilized to uncover prior art references. This article will discuss a general approach for thinking about the prior art search process but is not a comprehensive guide on the subject. There are many other helpful resources that an inventor should consider in the process of searching for prior art.

### 1. Develop a List of Keywords



### 2. Read Related Scientific Literature to Generate Alternative Keywords



### 3. Consult a Prior Art Database
