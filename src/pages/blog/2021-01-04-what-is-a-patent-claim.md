## Background

35 U.S.C. § 112(b) states that "\[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention." And this language is consistent with some of the earliest language of our patent laws.<sup>1</sup> Despite the trend of courts looking to the rest of the patent for clarification on what the claims entail, the claims are still indisputably the most important part of the patent document. They are "the portion of the patent document that defines the patentee's rights."<sup>2</sup>



## Types of Patent Claims
