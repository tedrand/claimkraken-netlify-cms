On January 6, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a memorandum clarifying its indefiniteness analysis approach under 35 U.S.C. Section 112 in AIA post-grant proceedings. These proceedings include Reissues, Ex Parte Reexams, Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs), and Supplemental Examinations.<sup>1</sup> The memorandum notes that until recently, the approaches for claim construction and indefiniteness applied by the USPTO in these proceedings differed from the way courts would apply the standards. In 2018, the USPTO changed its standard for claim construction from the Broadest Reasonable Interpretation (BRI) to the *Phillips* standard to harmonize the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB's) proceedings relative to the federal courts. This new decision to adopt the *Nautilus* standard for indefiniteness appears to be catalyzed by the same factors. Indeed, the memorandum notes that both the office and the courts "generally approach the definiteness requirement of \[Section] 112" during claim construction. Therefore they seem compelled to align the standards to provide uniformity (and avoid the potential for inconsistent judgments).<sup>2</sup>

## The Statutory Basis for Definiteness

35 U.S.C. Section 112(b) states that "\[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more claims *particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming* the subject matter which the inventor" seeks to patent (emphasis added). The motivation behind the definiteness requirement is that indefinite claims do not give a clear warning about the patentee's property rights, and do not adequately inform the public what the invention is.

### The Standards

In 2014, the Federal Circuit adopted the Office's approach to indefiniteness in *In re Packard*.<sup>3</sup>. Under this approach, the claims are sufficiently definite if "a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would not consider the claim language unclear.<sup>4</sup>
