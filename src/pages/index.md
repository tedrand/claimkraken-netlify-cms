  title: Why "ClaimKraken"?
  description: Giles Rich, the former Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit, once famously stated that “the name of the game is the claim.” Times have changed a lot since then, but the notion is still largely correct. Understanding how the Federal Circuit deals with modern patent claims is essential to understanding the patent laws' current state.

  the heart of your patent law news. Learn more about what's going on at the
  USPTO, the Federal Circuit, and beyond.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
